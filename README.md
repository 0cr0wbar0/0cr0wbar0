### Web developer seeking a junior frontend/backend/full-stack position.

Full-stack web development has a creative side to it that I very much enjoy, and I particularly like working with PHP. My final year project at uni was an interactive web app, written in PHP and JavaScript, that uses Docker to teach the syntactical basics of Rust (which you can try out at https://fyp.cr0wbar.dev). In light of the enjoyment I took from working on this project, I am looking for a junior position in frontend, backend or full-stack web development, where I may hone my skills and flex my web design muscles further.

I'm Finn, a programming novice and first-year compsci uni student

Currently learning Java :'3

I have a few months' worth of experience with Python and SQLite and that's pretty much the extent of my previous experience with programming lmao

I hope to hugely expand my scope of programming languages in the coming years

Pronouns are he/him
